# covidMemeCure

**ABOUT**

A simple project dedicated to curing the covid blues.

**HOW IT WORKS**

Used javascript to fetch image data from GIPHY API. The code uses the GIPHY API to retrieve gifs pertaining to the search criteria. In this case, the search critera has been set to "cute-dogs" and "rating-G" but can be set to whatever you wish. 

On-click event listeners were used on the “generate cure” button and dark mode toggle to retrieve new data from GIPHY and add an “active” toggle to specific HTML element ID’s for color-switching.

CSS was used to write keyframes to animate clouds and the moon rising and falling. 

Media queries were also used to add responsiveness to the browser for different screen size

You can generate your own GIPHY API link with your own parameters here:
