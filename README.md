# covidMemeCure

**ABOUT**

A simple project dedicated for curing the covid blues.

**HOW IT WORKS**

The code uses the GIPHY API to retrieve gifs pertaining to the search criteria. In this case, the search critera has been set to "cute-dogs" and "rating-G" but can be set to whatever you wish.

You can generate your own GIPHY API link with your own parameters here:

**Future improvements list**

\*Making it simpler for users to add their own GIPHY developer API code and search criteria.
\*Add more styling to the background.
\*Add sound affects to button click.
