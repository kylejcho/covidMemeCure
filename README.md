# covidMemeCure

**ABOUT**

A simple project dedicated to curing the covid blues.

**HOW IT WORKS**

The code uses the GIPHY API to retrieve gifs pertaining to the search criteria. In this case, the search critera has been set to "cute-dogs" and "rating-G" but can be set to whatever you wish.

You can generate your own GIPHY API link with your own parameters here:

**FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS LIST**

-Making it simpler for users to add their own GIPHY developer API code and search criteria.

-Add more styling to the background.

-Add sound affects to button click.

-"Add some cupcakes" as requested by my girlfriend.
